Classification of ECG arrhythmia using a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN)



The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a useful diagnostic
tool to monitor heartbeats and diagnose various cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs) and conditions such as myocardial infraction
(MI) and arrthythmia. In this paper, a method is proposed based
on deep convolution neural networks (CNN) for the classification
of heartbeats which is able to accurately classify five different
arrhythmias and MI. The CNN architecture is implemented
based on the research paper ”ECG arrthythmia classification
using a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN)”.
The methodology is evaluated on a publicly available MITBIH
arrhythmia dataset and PTB Diagnostic ECG Database.
According to the result, the model is able to make prediction
with average classification of 99.10% accuracy.
